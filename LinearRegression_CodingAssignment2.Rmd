```{r}
# Introduce a new column called sprint highlighting slow and fast sprinters
heptathlon = heptathlon %>% mutate(sprint = ifelse(run200m <= 25 & run800m <= 129, 'fast', 'slow'))

## It is observed that few people were able to finish their race around 25-26 secs and jump around 6.0 m whereas it was also observed that one finished the race in less than 23 secs and was able to jump more than 7m.

## There are 2 levels. Reference level is fast.

## R-squared value is around 40%.


```{r}
# Fit a linear model for approximating *score* as a function of *shot* and *sprint*. Print the model's summary and answer the following questions:

# 1. Did the addition of the new predictor *shot* improve the model accuracy? 
# 2. *True/false* (explain in one line): the model suggests that there is a possible linear relationship between an athlete's score and shotput performance.
# 3. For a 1 metre increase in shot put throw and with the same sprint performance, we can say with 95% confidence that the athlete's score will increase/decrease by an amount in the interval [?, ?].
model = lm(data = heptathlon, score~shot+sprint)
summary(model)

```
## 1. Yes the accuracy got increased to 67%.
## 2. True, because the p value is very small.
## 3. [249.7-1.9658,249.7+1.9658]

#  Using the model built above, extract the slope and intercept for estimating the *score* of *slow* and *fast* athletes.

# Fit a linear model for approximating *score* as a function of *shot*, *javelin*, and *sprint*. Print the model's summary and answer the following questions:

#1. Did the addition of the new predictor *javelin* improve the model accuracy? 
#2. *True/false* (explain in one line): the model suggests that there is a possible linear relationship between an athlete's score and javelin performance.
#3. For a 1 metre increase in shot put throw and with the same javelin and sprint performance, we can say with 95% confidence that the athlete's score will increase/decrease by an amount in the interval [?, ?].
model = lm(data = heptathlon, score~shot+sprint+javelin)
summary(model)
```
## No.. Adding additional predictor didnâ€™t increase the accuracy of the model
## No linear relationship between javelin and score because of the large p value.
## Interval [249-1.9660,249+1.9660]


```{r}
# Fit a linear model for approximating *score* as a function of *highjump*, and *sprint*. Print the model's summary and answer the following questions:

# 2. Considering a p-value of 10% as cutoff, are there any insignificant features?

model=lm(data = heptathlon, score~highjump+sprint)
summary(model)

```
## Accuracy is around 83%
## By considering p values there are no insignificant features
